# OroActivityBundle

OroActivityBundle helps classify certain entity types as activities and enables a special relation type between an entity and activities. Activity relations can be managed in the entity management UI and in the DB migration files.

Please see [online documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/backend/bundles/platform/ActivityBundle/) for more information.
