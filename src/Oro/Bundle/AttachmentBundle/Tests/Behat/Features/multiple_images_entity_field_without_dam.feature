Feature: Multiple Images entity field without DAM
  In order to manage entity field configuration
  As an administrator
  I should be able to create entity field with type Multiple Images without Digital Asset Manager

  Scenario: Create Multiple Images entity field
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to System/ Entities/ Entity Management
    And I filter "Name" as is equal to "User"
    And I click view User in grid
    And I click "Create field"
    And I fill form with:
      | Field name    | custom_images   |
      | Storage type  | Table column    |
      | Type          | Multiple Images |
    And I click "Continue"
    And I should see "Allowed MIME Types" with options:
      | Value                    |
      | image/gif                |
      | image/jpeg               |
      | image/png                |
    And I fill form with:
      | Label                   | Custom Images |
      | File Size (MB)          | 10            |
      | Thumbnail Width         | 64            |

    And I save and close form
    Then I should see "Field saved" flash message
    When I click update schema
    Then I should see "Schema updated" flash message

    When I fill "User Form With Multiple Images" with:
      | Custom Image 1 | 300x300.png |

      | Custom Image 1 | The mime type of the file is invalid ("image/png"). Allowed mime types are "image/jpeg". |

    When I click "Add Image"
    Then I should not see "Add Image"
