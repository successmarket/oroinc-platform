# OroSecurityBundle

OroSecurityBundle extends Symfony security capabilities to enable a role-based ACL security system in the Oro applications.

The bundle enables developers to set up access restrictions for entities and non-entity related actions using the DOC-block annotations and the YAML configuration files. It also provides UI for application administrators to configure the entity-specific permissions for particular user roles based on the entity ownership.

For more information, see the [Security section of online developer documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/security/).
