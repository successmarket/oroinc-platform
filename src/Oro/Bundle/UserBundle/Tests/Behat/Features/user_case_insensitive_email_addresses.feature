Feature: User Case Insensitive Email Addresses
  In order to avoid possible user mistakes
  As an administrator
  I want to disable admin user registration with emails if the same email with a different capitalization already belongs to some backoffice user
  As a user
  I must be able to login with email in another case if "Case Insensitive Email Addresses" is enabled
  I must not be able to login with email in another case if "Case Insensitive Email Addresses" is disabled

      | Username | CHARLIE@example.com |
      | Password | charlie             |
    When I click "Log in"
    Then I should see "Your login was unsuccessful. Please check your e-mail address and password before trying again. If you have forgotten your password, follow \"Forgot your password?\" link."
