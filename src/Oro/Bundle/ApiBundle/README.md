# OroApiBundle

OroApiBundle enables the Web API development framework for the application data. It provides the ability to define API in the YAML configuration files regardless of standards or formats. Out-of-the-box, the bundle opens REST API that conforms the JSON:API specification and enables CRUD operations support for the application ORM entities.

Please see [documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/api/) for more details.
