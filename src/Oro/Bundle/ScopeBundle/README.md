# Scopes

OroScopeBundle introduces the Scope entity into the Oro applications. 

OroScopeBundle enables developers to establish a relation between scopes and other application data, then calculate current scopes at runtime at any point of the application flow and obtain authorized data for the scope. Please see [online documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/master/backend/bundles/platform/ScopeBundle/) for more information.
